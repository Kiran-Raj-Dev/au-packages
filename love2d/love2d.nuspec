    <summary>LÖVE is an awesome framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua.</summary>
    <description>LÖVE is an *awesome* framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua. It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS.
LÖVE is totally free, and can be used in anything from friendly open-source hobby projects, to evil, closed-source commercial ones. 
# Open Source
LÖVE is licensed under the liberal zlib/libpng license. 
# Community
If you get stuck, many friendly people are ready to help you at the forums. Be warned, however, that it sometimes gets too friendly.
# Games
LÖVE has been used for commercial projects, game jams, prototyping, and everything in between. Here are a few examples.

This package is to install Love2D.
**Please Note:** This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.

[Changelog](https://love2d.org/wiki/11.3):
```
* Added support for FLAC audio files.
* Added support for microphone recording on Android.
* Added t.audio.mic (false by default). On Android, setting it to true requests microphone recording permission from the user.
* Added Decoder:clone.
* Added Data:getFFIPointer.
* Added Joystick:getDeviceInfo.
* Added Joystick:getGamepadMappingString and love.joystick.getGamepadMappingString(guid).
* Added love.math.colorToBytes and love.math.colorFromBytes.
* Added &apos;usedpiscale&apos; boolean (true by default) to love.window.setMode and love.conf. Disables automatic DPI scaling when false.
* Added love.window.getDisplayOrientation and a love.displayrotated callback.
* Added love.window.get/setVSync, to allow setting vsync without recreating the window.
* Added love.window.getSafeArea.
* Added an optional vertex count parameter to Mesh:setVertices.
* Added support for rgba4, rgb5a1, rgb565, rgb10a2, rg11b10f, r8, rg8, r16, rg16, r16f, rg16f, r32f, and rg32f formats in ImageData and Images.
* Added support for loading .dds files that contain uncompressed pixel data.

* Changed audio file type detection, so it probes all supported backends for unrecognized extensions.

* Fixed &quot;bad lightuserdata&quot; errors when running love on some arm64 devices.
* Fixed boot.lua&apos;s line numbers in stack traces to match its source code.
* Fixed the deprecation system not fully restarting when love.event.quit(&quot;restart&quot;) is used.
* Fixed love.isVersionCompatible.
* Fixed named Channels persisting across love.event.quit(&quot;restart&quot;) occurrences.
* Fixed race conditions when different love.physics Worlds are used in different threads.
* Fixed World:getJoints to return the fully resolved type of the Joint, instead of the base type.
* Fixed love.timer.sleep(0) to return control to the OS scheduler instead of being a no-op.
* Fixed love.math.randomNormal incorrectly using cached state after love.math.setRandomSeed or setRandomState.
* Fixed love.data.hash returning an incorrect hash for certain input sizes.
* Fixed love.data.newByteData to cause a Lua error instead of crashing when invalid arguments are used.
* Fixed the Data-returning variant of love.filesystem.read and File:read to return the number of bytes that were read.
* Fixed love.filesystem&apos;s require loaders to error instead of crashing when no argument is given.
* Fixed love.filesystem.mount(Data).
* Fixed a memory leak when loading files in some situations.
* Fixed t.audio.mixwithsystem.
* Fixed audio clicks immediately after playing a Source on iOS.
* Fixed Source:play + Source:stop + Source:play looping the first few ms of sound for streaming Sources on iOS.
* Fixed Source:play + Source:seek looping the first few ms of sound for streaming Sources on iOS.
* Fixed occasional pops in streaming sources on iOS. 
* Fixed love.audio.play(sources) to use previously set playback positions on stopped Sources.
* Fixed Source:setEffect(name, true) and Source:getEffect(name) when the effect has no associated Filter.
* Fixed love.audio.newSource(filename, &quot;queue&quot;) to cause a Lua error.
* Fixed Source:setPitch to error if the given pitch is &lt;= 0, NaN, or infinity.
* Fixed video seeking and pausing in various scenarios.
* Fixed an audio Source memory leak when a Video gets garbage collected after playing it.
* Fixed video playback support on some Adreno-based Android devices.
* Fixed black fringes around text in some situations.
* Fixed extreme flickering when text moves along non-integer coordinates.
* Fixed the first character in a string sometimes not being processed during text vertex generation.
* Fixed Text:set(&quot; &quot;) not clearing any previously set text in a Text object.
* Fixed love.graphics.getTextureTypes to return a table with boolean values in its fields instead of number values.
* Fixed lines not rendering properly if a single line has more than 65,000 vertices.
* Fixed a pixel shader performance regression on some graphics drivers when OpenGL 3 or OpenGL ES 3 is used.
* Fixed text not showing up on Radeon HD 3000-series graphics cards on Windows.
* Fixed non-integer DPI scale values being truncated to integers in love.graphics.newCanvas.
* Fixed creating depth canvases on Windows systems when using an Intel HD 3000 GPU.
* Fixed automatic batching performance to be more consistent on all operating systems.
* Fixed gammaToLinearPrecise in shaders not being as precise as it should be.
* Fixed ImageData:paste and ImageData:setPixel to have more consistent clamping and rounding of color values when different formats are used.
