Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula.

### Efficient
- Nim generates native dependency-free executables, not dependent on a virtual machine, which are small and allow easy redistribution.
- The Nim compiler and the generated executables support all major platforms like Windows, Linux, BSD and macOS.
- Nim's memory management is deterministic and customizable with destructors and move semantics, inspired by C++ and Rust. It is well-suited for embedded, hard-realtime systems.
- Modern concepts like zero-overhead iterators and compile-time evaluation of user-defined functions, in combination with the preference of value-based datatypes allocated on the stack, lead to extremely performant code.
- Support for various backends: it compiles to C, C++ or JavaScript so that Nim can be used for all backend and frontend needs.

### Expressive
- Nim is self-contained: the compiler and the standard library are implemented in Nim.
- Nim has a powerful macro system which allows direct manipulation of the AST, offering nearly unlimited opportunities.

### Elegant
- Macros cannot change Nim's syntax because there is no need for it â€” the syntax is flexible enough.
- Modern type system with local type inference, tuples, generics and sum types.
- Statements are grouped by indentation but can span multiple lines.

### Notes
- By default this package install's Nim along with MingW compiler and added to `PATH`.
- You can disable by passing a parameter. See [here](#package-specific)
- Virus scanning: High quantity of false positives is found due to unsigned binaries. See https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/17820.

## Package Specific
### Package Parameters

The following package parameters can be set:
- `/AddToPath:` - Add the binaries to `PATH`. Allowed values are either `true` or `false`. By default `true`. 

To pass parameters, use `--params "''"` (e.g. `choco install nim [other options] --params="'/AddToPath:false'"`).

To have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.

**Please Note:** This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
